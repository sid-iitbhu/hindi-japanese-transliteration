#Description of folders
##Hindi  -
contains list of hindi names part by part and a full list at the end
##Testing - 
contains the testing data that was used
##Japanese - 
contains list of hindi names in japanese(Katakana script) part by part and the full list at the end
##src - 
contains the source codes written in java

# Files
new-kata and devanagari katakana mappings - list of mappings (We have used new-kata)
hindi.arpa - arpa file generated by using the hindi names corpus. First converted it into syllabic 
              format and then ran the Arpa generation function in the Berkeley LM library
parallel corpus - hindi japanese names given side by side

#source code files description
###generateArpa 
generates the arpa file used to score the output 
###GenerationProbability 
                      calculates the emission probabilities of a
                      given katakana symbol to generate a given hindi syllable
                      [ブ, भि ]=-0.7781512503836436
                      [バー, बखा ]=-0.26884531229257996
                      [ディ, धधि ]=-0.6766936096248666
                      [ フ ー , हन ]=0.0 While calculating the final probabilities the 0.0 are replaced with
                      -100 the same as ARPA.
###generateSeparatedJapanese - 
Insert spaces in the given katakana sequence so as to convert it into a mappable 
                            format
###generationProb- 
calls the GenerationProbability's main method
###hindiSyllableGen - 
generates the hindi word's syllables (used in corpus preprocessing to facilitate running the 
                    berkeleyLm arpa generation function). अंकित 
                    becomes अ  ं  कि  त 
###mappings -
reads the mappings from the file and put them in the hashmap and returns the hashmap
###new_candidateGenerator -
generates the various possible candidates for a given katakana sequence
###transliterate - 
the main class that is run to get the final output.

All the file paths are hard coded in the source code. Change them accordingly prior to running it.
